# Health-Tracker
## Lab 26: Android Fundamentals
* One key part of health is building finger strength and endurance. On the main page, display a number and a button. The number should increase when the button is clicked.
* Still on the main page, add a stopwatch. Have a button to [Start/Pause] and [Reset] the clock. The start/pause button should toggle between saying “start” and “pause.” And you should only be able to reset when the stopwatch is paused.
* At the top of our main page, we want to inspire our users with images of the type of person they can become. Display an image with a caption below it. (The caption should NOT be part of the image; it should be text.) Allow users to cycle through images and read the captions. Pressing next should go to the next image and its caption, pressing prev should go back. The app should display a (1/N), (2/N) … indicator so users know how many items are in the list
